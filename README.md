## 🐍 Python-Based Fund Analysis

I started by importing and exploring a dataset of over 2500 mutual fund schemes.  
🔗 [Python Script](https://github.com/sushantpawar01/Mutual-Fund-Analysis/blob/main/Mutual%20Fund%20Python%20Analysis.ipynb)

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed unnecessary columns
- Handled missing values
- Standardized numeric formats (returns, expense ratios)

### 2. Data Description & Understanding
- Statistical summaries using Pandas: mean, median, mode, min, max, std deviation
- Analyzed fund distributions across return rates, risk levels, and fund age

### 3. Data Normalization
- Used `MinMaxScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing` to normalize numeric fields
- Compared returns and expense ratios on a common scale

### 4. Fund Scoring & Ranking
Custom scoring formula based on:
- High 3-Year Returns  
- Low Expense Ratio  
- Moderate Fund Age  
- Consistent 1-Year Return > 0

### 5. Final Output – Top 30 Funds
Extracted the **Top 30 Mutual Funds** with best return-low risk balance
